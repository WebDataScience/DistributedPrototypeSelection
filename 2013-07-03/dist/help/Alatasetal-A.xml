		<objective>The genetic algorithm proposed by Alatas et al. is conceived for mining both positive and negative quantitative association rules.</objective>

		<howWork>The genetic learning is performed iteratively until a maximum number of generations is reached.
First, an initial population called uniform population is created by splitting a given number of seed chromosomes into two or more segments depending on a user-specified number of dividing points.
The segments of each chromosome are then inverted individually, i. e., the values of their genes are basically changed according to a fixed scheme.
The result is a population of a determined size in which all the combinations of these segments are computed for each seed chromosome.
Then, within a double loop, the genetic operators are applied to chromosomes.
The fitness values of individuals may be decreased at the end of the first internal loop whenever in the current population they involve records covered by the previous best rules.
Finally, to increase the quality of the final best rules, the amplitudes of intervals may also be decreased until the number of covered records be smaller than the records covered by their original intervals.</howWork>
