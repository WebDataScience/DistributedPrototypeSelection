		<howWork>This algorithm finds
	a subset S of the training set T such that every member of T is closer to a
	member of S of the same class than to a member of S of a different class. It
	begins by randomly selecting one instance belonging to each output class from
	T and putting them in S. Then each instance in T is classified using only the
	instances in S. If an instance is misclassified, it is added to S, thus ensuring
	that it will be classified correctly. This process is repeated until there are no
	instances in T that are misclassified. This algorithm ensures that all instances
	in T are classified correctly, though it does not guarantee a minimal set.</howWork>
