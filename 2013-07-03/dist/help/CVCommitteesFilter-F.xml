		<howWork>
The steps of the Cross-Validated Committees Filter are the following:

1) Partition the training set into n subsets.
2) The C4.5 algorithm is trained n times, each time leaving out one of the subsets
from the training set.
3) These n classifiers tag each example in the training set.
4) The filter compares the real class of each example with the n labels of the classifiers,
and decides whether or not to remove the example using a voting scheme.
