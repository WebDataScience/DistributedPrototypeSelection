		<howWork>
The process carried out by the Ensemble Filter is described below:

1) Split the training data into n equal sized parts.
2) For each of these n parts, m filter algorithms are trained on the other n − 1 parts.
3) The m resulting classifiers are then used to tag each instance in the excluded part as
either correct or mislabeled, by comparing the training label with that assigned by the
classifier.
4) Decide which instances must be removed from the training set by means a vote-based scheme.
