		<objective>FP-growth generates frequent itemsets by exploring a compressed representation of the given database in a bottom-up fashion.
Experimental results show that FP-growth is efficient and scalable for mining both long and short frequent patterns.</objective>

		<howWork>In order to represent the given database as a prefix tree (called a FP-tree), FP-growth scans one transaction at a time and maps each transaction onto a path in such a tree.
The physical storage of the FP-tree also provides a header table containing all items with their support along with a start pointer to a linked list.
Thus, all nodes referring to the same item are linked together, so that all transactions containing a specific item can quickly be found and counted by traversing this list.
The algorithm proceeds as a recursive elimination scheme.
In a pre-processing step all items from the transactions that are not frequent individually are deleted.
Then, all paths in the tree that contain the least frequent item are selected and this item is deleted from them.
The reduced FP-tree computed at the end of this operation (called a projected database) is processed recursively.
Finally, on return, this item is also removed from the database of all transactions and the process starts over by processing the next frequent item.</howWork>
