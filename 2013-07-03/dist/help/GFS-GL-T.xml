		<howWork>Given a Mamdani Fuzzy Rule Set obtained by a Fuzzy Rule Base System this method adapts
		the Data Base (fuzzy partitions). 
		This genetic tuning process is based on a linguistic 2-tuples representation that allows the lateral displacement of the labels by considering only one parameter, maintaining the interpretability associated with the final linguistic model at a reasonable level.
		The tuning is applied to the level of linguistic partition, it means, the pair (Xi,label) takes the same tuning value in all the rules where it is considered.
		It uses the genetic model of CHC, it is a genetic algorithm that presents a good trade-off between exploration and explotation, being a dood choice in problems with complex search spaces. The mutation is not considered in CHC.
		This way to work involves a simplification of the search space that eases the derivation of optimal models and therefore improves the desired tradeoff, especially in complex or high-dimensional problems.
