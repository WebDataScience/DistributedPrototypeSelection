		<howWork>
		This approach is an extension of the lateral tuning to also perform a tuning of the support amplitude of the membership functions. 
		To adjust the displacements and amplitudes of the membership function supports it proposes a new rule representation that considers two parameters, one of the represents the lateral displacement and the other the amplitude variation of the label.
		Each label can be represented by a 3-tuple representation, the first parameter is like in the 2-tuples representation, an the other allows to increase or reduce the support amplitude of a label until a 50% of its original size.
		It reduces the search space respect to the classical tuning of the DB. In this case, the tuning is applied to the level of linguistic partition.
		It uses the genetic model of CHC, it is a genetic algorithm that presents a good trade-off between exploration and explotation, being a dood choice in problems with complex search spaces. The mutation is not considered in CHC.
		This way to work involves a simplification of the search space that eases the derivation of optimal models and therefore improves the desired tradeoff, especially in complex or high-dimensional problems.
