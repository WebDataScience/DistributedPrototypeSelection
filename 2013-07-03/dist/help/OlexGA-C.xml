		<type> Text Classification model by rules </type>
		<objective> 
				To extract a set of maximally accurate 
				rules that completely defines the feature space.
		</objective>
		<howWork>
				OlexGA is a Pittsburgh-style rule learner for text classification. 
				A classifier is of the form "classify document d under category c if either t1 or ... or tn occurs in d and none of tn+1, ..., tn+m occurs in d", where each ti is a feature.
				The ﬁtness of a chromosome (representing a classifier) is the value of 
				the F-measure resulting from applying the classifier to the training set.
				After population has been initialized, evolution takes place by iterating elitism, 
				selection, crossover and mutation, until a pre-deﬁned number of generations is created. 
				At each step, a repair operator, aimed at correcting possible illegal individuals generated 
				by crossover/mutation, is applied.
