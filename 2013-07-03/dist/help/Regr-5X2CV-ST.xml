Stat-Regr-5x2cv is a method for comparing the performance of two regression algorithms using statistics techniques. It can be used in k-folds and 5x2 cross validation training  experiments.
Stat-Regr-5x2cv is associated to the training and testing results of the two models in an experiment that are to be compared. Once those models has been trained and tested, the Stat-Regr-5x2cv takes place. 
The process calculates the mean cuadratic error for each partition results. The statistical sample includes all of those error measures for each method to be compared. Then the 5x2cv-Test is executed with the Null hypothesis as true if difference in means is equal to 0.
