Stat-Regr-WilcoxonSR is a method for comparing the performance of two regression algorithms using statistics techniques. It can be used in k-folds and 5x2 cross validation training  experiments.
Stat-Regr-WilcoxonSR is associated to the training and testing results of the two models in an experiment that are to be compared. Once those models has been trained and tested, the Stat-Regr-WilcoxonSR takes place. 
The process calculates the nean cuadratic error for each partition results. The statistical sample includes all of those error measures for each method to be compared. Then the Wilconxon signed rank test is executed with the Null hypothesis as true if difference in means is equal to 0.
