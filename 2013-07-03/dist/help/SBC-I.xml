		<type>Preprocess Method. Data Rebalancing. Undersampling Method</type>

		<objective>Balance the class distribution for changing the data space when applying usual classifiers in imbalanced domains</objective>

		<howWork>First, clusters all the training samples into some clusters. Then, selects a suitable number of majority class samples from each cluster
		by considering the ratio of the number of majority class samples to the number of minority class samples in the cluster</howWork>

			<param>Ratio: ratio of size among majority selection with respecty minority samples</param>
			<param>Ncluster: number of clusters to apply the clustering algorithm at the beginning</param>
