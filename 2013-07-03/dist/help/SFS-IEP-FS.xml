	<generalDescription>  

		<type>Non Evolutionary Filter Stochastic method</type>

		<objective>Feature Selection. This method allows search to follow feature subsets that are randomly generated</objective>

		<howWork>Sequential Forward Search is a greedy algorithm that starts with zero selected features and selects the most
			promising feature according to the measure in each step. The algorithm stops when an inconsistency threshold is
			reached (and no additional features can be added) or when all features are selected.
