			To determine a set of decision trees that on the basis of answers to questions about the input attributes predicts correctly the value of the target attribute.

		SMOTEBagging oversamples minority class instances using SMOTE preprocessing algorithm. In this method both classes contribute to each bag with N_maj instances. A SMOTE resampling rate a% is set in each iteration (ranging from 10% in the first iteration to 100% in the last, always being multiple of 10) and this ratio defines the number of positive instances (a% * N_maj) randomly resampled (with replacement) from the original data-set in each iteration. The rest of the positive instances are generated by SMOTE algorithm (until the data-set is balanced). Besides, the set of negative instances is bootstrapped in each iteration in order to form a more diverse ensemble.

			<param>
				prune: wether to prune or not prune the tree. It is a boolean value that determines if the algorithm applies a prune process after building the tree
			</param>
			<param>
				confidence: is the confidence level. It is a float value that determines what is the minimal confidence that must has a leaf in order to can be considered in the tree
			</param>
			<param>
				minItemsets: is the minimum number of item-sets per leaf. It is an integer value that determines how much data instances must contain a leaf in order to can be created
			</param>
			<param>
				Number of Classifiers: is the number of iterations that the bagging procedure will be executed (the number of classifiers that will form the ensemble)
