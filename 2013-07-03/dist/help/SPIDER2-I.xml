		<type>Preprocess Method. Instance Selection. Selective Preprocessing</type>

		<objective>Filtering or relabeling of difficult examples from the majority class and local over-sampling of the minority class</objective>

		<howWork>This method consists of two phases corresponding to preprocessing of majority and minority classes respectively. In the first phase, it identifies characteristics of examples from 
		the majority class, and it either removes or relabels noisy examples from this one. In the second phase, it identifies characteristic of examples from the minority class considering changes 
		introduced in the first phase. Then, noisy examples from the minority class are amplified by replicating them.</howWork>
