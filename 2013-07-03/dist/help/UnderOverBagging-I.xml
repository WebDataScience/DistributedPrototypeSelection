		UnderBagging to OverBagging (UnderOverBagging) makes use of both oversampling and undersampling techniques, a resampling rate (a%) is set in each iteration (ranging from 10% to 100% always being multiple of 10), this ratio defines the number of instances taken from each class (a% * N_maj instances). Hence, the first classifiers are trained with a lower number of instances than the last ones. This way, the diversity is boosted.

		<parameterSpec>  
			<param>
				prune: wether to prune or not prune the tree. It is a boolean value that determines if the algorithm applies a prune process after building the tree
			</param>
			<param>
				confidence: is the confidence level. It is a float value that determines what is the minimal confidence that must has a leaf in order to can be considered in the tree
			</param>
			<param>
				minItemsets: is the minimum number of item-sets per leaf. It is an integer value that determines how much data instances must contain a leaf in order to can be created
			</param>
			<param>
				Number of Classifiers: is the number of iterations that the bagging procedure will be executed (the number of classifiers that will form the ensemble)
