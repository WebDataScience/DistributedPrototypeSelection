		<type>Statistical method for comparing  classification methods  performance.</type>

		<objective>Statistical comparing of the performance of a classification model method. Statistical tests, like Wilcoxon signed ranks or Mann-Whitney u, are executed for comparing methods purposes.</objective>

		<howWork>
StatTabularCL is a method for comparing the performance of classification algorithms using statistics techniques. It can be used in k-folds and 5x2 cross validation training  experiments.
StatTabularCL is associated to the training and testing results of all of the models in an experiment that are to be compared. Once those models has been trained and tested, the StatGeneralCL takes place. 
The process calculates the percentage of correctly classified examples for each of the partitions results. The statistical sample includes all of those error measures for each method to be compared.  
With the Royston implementation of the W test it is contrasted if error distributions are  normal for the samples to be compare. If the distributions are normal, then if the samples are of equal variance the t test is executed. If distributions are normal but they have different variances then the tvar test. Finally, if the samples are not normal, then the Wilcoxon test is executed. 
The statistical test are executed in order to find evidence to assert that the error distribution of the different classification methods are different or not. If they are different, then it can be stated which one is  of better performance.
