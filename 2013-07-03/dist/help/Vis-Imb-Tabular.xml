		<type>Statistical method for comparing classification methods performance.</type>

		<objective>Statistical comparing of the performance of a classification model method. Statistical tests, like Wilcoxon signed ranks or Mann-Whitney u, are executed for comparing methods purposes.</objective>

		<howWork>
StatTabularImb is a method for comparing the performance of classification algorithms using statistics techniques. It can be used in k-folds cross validation training experiments.
StatTabularImb is associated to the training and testing results of all of the models in an experiment that are to be compared. Once those models has been trained and tested, the StatGeneralImb takes place. 
The process calculates the corresponding imbalanced measure for each of the partitions results. The statistical sample includes all of those imbalanced measures for each method to be compared.
