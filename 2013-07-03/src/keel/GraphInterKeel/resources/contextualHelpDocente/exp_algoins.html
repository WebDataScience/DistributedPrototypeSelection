  <p><b>INSERT ALGORITHM</b></p>
</div>

<p>In order to add an algorithm to our experiment, you must perform the following actions:
	
<ol>
  <li>Select the desired option from the tool bar on the left, according to the type of algorithm we want to insert: 
    pre-process, method, post-process or test. </li>
  <li>Choose the desired algorithm from the tree structure. </li>
  <li>Click on the draw area.<br>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The methods available are knowledge extraction algorithms (decision tree and rule extraction in supervised learning, neural networks, etc.).</p>

		<p align="center"><img src="imag/exp_algoMet.jpg"></p><br>


<p>These algorithms are classified according to the family to whom they belong. These families appear in the drop-down tree, allowing the navigation throug the different algorithms until finding the one the user is interested in, as we can see in the above picture.</p>
