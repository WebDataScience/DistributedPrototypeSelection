</div>

  <p>All the DataSets created by the user or transformed from UCI 

    files, are called &quot;Complete DataSets&quot; and cannot be used in 

    experiments. First it's necessary to divide the whole file in pairs of 

    training and test files. </p>

  

<p>To divide a file, you must select the &quot;Complete DataSet&quot; and indicate 

  the root name of a directory that will contain all the files generated during the

  partition process. The name of the files is given automatically and depends 

  on the type of the partition selected. Viewing the name it is very easy to recognize 

  the type of the partition applied.<br><br>

    <div align="center"><img src="imag/data_partition.jpg"></div>

<p>There are four partition types available:</p>

<ul>

  <li>K - Fold Cross Validation.</li>

  <li>Partitions by defined percentages.</li>

  <li>5x2 Cross Validation.</li>

  <li>Stratification.</li>

</ul>

<p>Depending the one you select, differents parameters of partitions are 

  shown. You can modify them to customize the partition process.<br></p>
