  <p><b>VIEW DATA</b></p>

</div>

  <p>This feature allows you to view detailed information about an 

    existing DataSet. Information changes across the three tabs that appear in this 

    window:</p>

<ol>

  <li><b>DataSet View</b> <br>

    DataSet View allows you to load a DataSet file (in KEEL's format) by clicking on the 'Browser' button and view 

    its content. It is simmilar to a text editor although you cannot modify the data but only you can view them. When the file is loaded, this content appears in the 

    text zone and you can select more options in the other tabs.<br><br>
		
  	<div align="center"><img src="imag/data_viewShow.jpg"></div></li><br>

  </li>

  <li><b>Attribute Info</b><br>

    In this tab, users can obtain a detailed information about the attributes 

    defined in the DataSet. When you click over an attribute in the 

    table, the information appears. If the attribute's type is &quot;Integer&quot; 

    or &quot;Real&quot;, rank values, average and variance are shown. However, 

    if the attribute is &quot;Nominal&quot; you only view its possible values.<br>

    The little chart that appears in the window contains a distribution of the attribute's 

    values along the DataSet file. Cliking on it, the chart is expanded in a new 

    window for a best view.<br><br>

	<div align="center"><img src="imag/data_viewInfo.jpg"></div></li><br>

  <li><b>Charts 2D</b><br>

    The last tab allows you to compare differents attributes. It is very easy; the 

    user only must select the attributes from the two lists and press the 'View chart' button. 

    A graphic is shown and if you want to see it in a big size, you only must click 

    over it.<br>

    Also, if you need to include the generated chart in an article, web page or 

    publication, you can use the three buttons that appears over the chart. Using 

    them the graphic can be saved as a PNG or JPEG image (with a resolution of 

    1024x768 pixels) or as a PDF file, in which the chart is in a blank page.<br><br>
