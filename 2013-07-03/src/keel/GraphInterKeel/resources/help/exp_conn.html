  <p><b>CONNECTIONS</b></p>

</div>

<p>They allow you to connect algorithm outputs (or dataset) to the inputs of another 

  algorithm, creating a data flow that will be run later.</p>

<ol>
  <li><b>Insert connection:</b> to make a connection, select the <img src="imag/ico_flujo.jpg"> button  
    from the left tool bar. Then, click on the source node and finally click on 
    the target node.<br><br>
    <p align="center"><img src="imag/exp_conn1.jpg"></p>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> <b>Restrictions:</b> there are some restrictions that must be considered when making connections 
    between the different elements:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>A dataset cannot have inputs. </li>
      <li>The pre-processing algorithms can only receive inputs from a DataSet 
        or another pre-process method. </li>
      <li>Knowledge extraction methods can receive data from a DataSet, from a 
        pre-processing algorithm or from a previous method. </li>
      <li>The test algorithms must receive input data from a method or from a 
        post-processing algorithm. </li>
      <li>Test algorithms cannot have outputs. </li>
      <li>The graph cannot have any cycle. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
  <p>All these restrictions are verified in exectuion time when a connection is been created. 
    If one of these connections is not permited, the application will show an error 
    message. In next figures you can see some examples of incorrect graphs. </p>
