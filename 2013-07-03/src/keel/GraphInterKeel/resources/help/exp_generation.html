  <p><b>Generation of experiments</b></p>

</div>

<p>Once a experiment has been designed, the user can generate it through the option Run Experiment of the 'Tools' menu. Furthermore, it is possible to use the tools bar button:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="imag/experiments/generation1.jpg"></p>

<p>At this point, the software tool will perform several tests about the completeness of the experiment. Firstly, if it detects that there are missing partitions for some of the data sets employed, the following dialog will be shown, allowing regenerating them:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="imag/experiments/generation2.jpg"></p>
 
<p>This is the last opportunity to generate them. Else, the experiment will be generated incorrectly.</p>

<p>Secondly, if some of the elements of the graph are not connected by flows, the following warning will be prompt, and the isolated nodes will be discarded.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="imag/experiments/generation3.jpg"></p> 

<p>If everything is correct, the user will have to select a path for the experiment's zip file:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="imag/experiments/generation4.jpg"></p>  

<p>The generation process generates a ZIP file containing all the elements needed to run the experiment. If the experiment generation is completed successfully, the following message will be shown.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="imag/experiments/generation5.jpg"></p>   

<p>The experiment must be run using the <em>RunKeel</em> jar file located at <em>experiment/scripts</em>. In the following picture, we can see an example of the structure of directories that is created. We see that four directories are created:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="imag/experiments/generation6.jpg"></p>   

<ul>
	<li><b>exe</b> directory: it contains all the jar files of the algorithms inserted in the experiment.</li> 
	<li><b>scripts</b> directory: it contains the configuration files sorted by algorithm. Also, it contains the RunKeel.jar file which is used in order to run the experiment.</li> 
	<li><b>datasets</b> directory: it contains the used in the experiment. A directory for each dataset is created.</li> 
	<li><b>results</b> directory: it contains the output files generated by each algorithm.</li> 
</ul>
