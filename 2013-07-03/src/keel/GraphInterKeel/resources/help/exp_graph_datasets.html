<p>This module lets the user edit the current data sets selected for the experiment.</p>

<p>As in the <em>Select Datasets</em> panel, the user can still <em>Add</em> and <em>Delete</em> data sets to the experiment (from those already registered in the KEEL environment). Also, it is still possible to import new data sets.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the button <em>Edit</em> allows the user to indicate which partitions (training and test) desires to use. This way, it is possible to temporally alter the files which will be included in the experiment.</p>

<p>This dialog shows the initial files of the data set.  From it, is possible to <em>Remove</em> a pair of training a pair of training/test files, to <em>Remove All</em> files.</p> 

<p>Also, the dialog allows to <em>Add</em> a new pair of training and test files. To do so, they must be selected by using the search buttons: <img src="imag/experiments/datasets3.jpg"></p>
