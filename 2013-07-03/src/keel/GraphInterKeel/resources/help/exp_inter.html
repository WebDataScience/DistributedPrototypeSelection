<p>In this section we will see some additional considerations about other possibilities 

  that provides this application.</p>

<ol>

  <li><b>Context menu:</b> it is possible to access to the context menu by clicking with the right 

      button of the mouse on a certain node in the draw area. This menu depends on 

      the selected object and allows us to remove objects, to configure 

      algorithms parameters, etc...<br><br>

    </div>

  </li>

  <li><b>Objects selection:</b> in order to select a single element, just click with the left button of 

      the mouse over it. But if we want to select several elements, we click in an empty zone of the 

      draw area and drag the mouse until covering all the objects we 

      wish toselect. Finally we release the button and we get elements selected.<br>


  </li>

  <li><b>Move objects:</b> we can move one or several elements selected with the aid of the left button 

      of the mouse. You just have to click over the selected objects and, without release the button, drag them to the desired position. Another way is to use the keyboard cursors.<br>

  </li>

  <li><b>Remove objects:</b> in order to delete one or more objects from the graph we must 

      select them and press the <img src="imag/ico_borrar.jpg"> button of the upper tool bar.</p>

    <p>Also we can carry out this task from the context menu. <br>

    </p>

  </li>

  <li><b>Undo - Redo:</b> we can undo or redo the performed actions through the <img src="imag/ico_deshacer.jpg"> and <img src="imag/ico_rehacer.jpg"> 

      buttons of the upper tool bar.

  </li>

  <li><b>Snapshots:</b> it is possible to save the experiment design in an image format file (JPEG). 

      Using this option you will be able to insert it in any document, article, etc... This option is available through the <img src="imag/ico_snap.jpg"> button  

      of the upper tool bar. <br>

  </li>
