<p>The graph allows performing the following operations over its elements:</p>

<ol>
	<li><b>Context menu</b>: it is possible to access to the context menu by clicking with the right button of the mouse on a certain node in the draw area. This menu depends on the selected object and allows us to remove objects, to configure algorithms parameters, etc...</li>
