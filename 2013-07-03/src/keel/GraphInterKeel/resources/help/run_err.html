  <p><b>Errors during execution</b></p>
</div>
  
<p>During execution of a experiment can appears some errors due to an incorrect 
  algorithm, a file missing or various reasons. If an error happens, the execution 
  is stopped, because it can affect to others algorithms that will be executed 
  later. </p>
<p>In the top text area of RunKeel's window appear information about the detected 
  error. This information is very useful to correct them, and if the user can 
  repair the error, replace bad files, missing files, etc, and press &quot;Run 
  Experiment&quot; button, the execution will continue at this point, because 
  isn't necessary to execute all the experiment right from the beginning.</p>
<p><b>Important for algorithm's developers:</b> The algorithms must return value 
  0 if the execution is correct, otherwise if a problem occurs must return a non 
  0 value. Also, error messages must be written in standard error file (depends 
  programming language), to show the message in text area.</p>
