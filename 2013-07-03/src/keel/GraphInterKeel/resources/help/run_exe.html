<p>When you design an experiment, you obtain a .ZIP file containing all the 

  files needed to run the experiment in any computer that has 

  a Java Virtual Machine installed. You need to extract the content of the compressed file 

  and then you will obtain a directory called <i>&quot;experiment&quot;</i> (as you had called your experiment). Inside it, 

  there is a new directory called &quot;scripts&quot; in which you can execute 

  RunKEEL application by typing <nobr><b>java -jar RunKeel.jar</b></nobr> in a console. Then, the experiment
	begins to run. When it finishes, you will obtain at the command prompt the message <b>&quot;EXPERIMENT COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY&quot;</b></p>
