<p>When the user designs an experiment, a .ZIP file will be obtained containing all the files needed to run the experiment in any computer that has a Java Virtual Machine installed. It is necessary to extract the content of the compressed file and then you will obtain a directory called <em>"experiment"</em> (as you had called your experiment). Inside it, there is a new directory called "scripts" in which you can launch the RunKEEL application by typing <b>java -jar RunKeel.jar</b> in a console. Then, the experiment begins to run.</p>
 
<p>When it finishes, the user will obtain at the command prompt the message <b>"EXPERIMENT COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY"</b>:</p>
