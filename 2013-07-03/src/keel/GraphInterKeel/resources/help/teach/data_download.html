<p>This is a special KEEL feature. This section provides a simply way to keep 
  DataSets updated and prepared to be used in experiments. If the user has correctly 
  configurated a connection to Internet, he can download new data files from the 
  KEEL's server to his local computer.</p>
<p>When the program obtains the necessary information from the server, in the 
  window appears various DataSets files that can be selected by marking them. 
  Later, if the &quot;Download&quot; button is pressed, the download of selected 
  files will start. And the files will be stored in the path specified. Pressing 
  the &quot;Stop&quot; button, the download process will be stoped.</p>
