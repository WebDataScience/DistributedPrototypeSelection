  <p><b>UCI to KEEL</b></p>

</div>

  <p>This feature allows you to transform your files 

    in UCI format (plain text) to KEEL format. Notice that if you want to use your 

    own DataSets, the design of the experiments will only use DataSets accordin to

    KEEL format. This conversion is done in a semi-authomatic way, across the following tabs of the window:</p>

<ol>

  <li><b>Heading</b> <br>

    The first step is to define the DataSet's heading according to KEEL format. This 

    process is so easy, and simmilar to the one that is described in the 'New DataSet' section. Notice 

    that this interface is apparently identical.  <br><br>

    <div align="center"><img src="imag/data_uci.jpg"></div><br>
	</li>


  <li><b>Names file</b><br>

    If you don't know the information about the attributes, it is necessary to fill the 

    DataSet's heading. So, you can load a names file downloaded from UCI's web page, 

    and, from its content, you can obtain the appropiate information to complete the 

    heading definition. <br><br>
		
    <div align="center"><img src="imag/data_uciNames.jpg"></div><br>
	</li>

  <li><b>Data file</b><br>

    At this point, you must load a data file given by UCI with the content of the DataSet. 

    This data with no format will be adapted to the KEEL's format. <br><br>

    <div align="center"><img src="imag/data_uciData.jpg"></div><br>
	
	</li>

  <li><b>Save</b><br>

    If you have filled the heading and loaded the content of the DataSet, now you only have 

    to save them to a file. <br><br>
		
    <div align="center"><img src="imag/data_uciSave.jpg"></div><br>
