<p>Once the algorithm has been inserted, we can configure the value of its parameters. 
To do so, you must double click on the algorithm symbol and a dialog is shown; also, you can get this dialog 

   through the emergent menu that will appear when right button of the mouse 

  is pressed (option <i>Show Parameters</i>).</p>
	
		 <p align="center"><img src="imag/exp_algopar.jpg"></p>

<p>At the top of this dialog we can indicate the number of times we want to 
  run the algorithm (only available for random methods). Each execution will 
  be made using a seed generated from the initial seed.</p>
  <br>
  In the table located in the center of the window, it appears all algorithm parameters established 
  to its initial values. You can modify them as you wish. If 
  you want to return to initial values, press the <img src="imag/ico_default.jpg"> button.
