  <p><b>ALGORITHM TYPES</b></p>

</div>

<p>The methods available are knowledge extraction algorithms (decision tree and rule extraction in supervised learning, neural networks, etc)</p>
<p align="center"><img src="imag/exp_algoMet.jpg"></p><br>

<p>These algorithms are classified according to the 

  family to whom they belong. These families appear in the drop-down tree, allowing the 

  navigation through the different algorithms until finding the one the user is interested in, as we can see in the above pictures. </p>
