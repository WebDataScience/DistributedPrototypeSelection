  <p><b>GENERATE EXPERIMENT</b></p>

</div>

<p>Once the experiment has been designed, you can generate it through the option <b>Run 

  Experiment</b> of the 'Tools' menu. Furthermore, you can use the tools bar <img src="imag/ico_run.jpg"> button. </p>

<p>This process generates a ZIP file containing all the elements needed to 

  run the experiment. The experiment must be run using the 

  RunKeel jar file located at &quote;experiment/scripts&quote;. </p>

<p>In the following picture, we can see an example of the structure of directories that is created. We 
  see that four directories are created.<br>

</p>

<ul>

  <li><b><i>exe</i> directory:</b> it contains all the jar files of the algorithms 

    inserted in the experiment. <br>

  </li>

  <li><b><i>scripts</i> directory:</b> it contains the configuration files sorted by algorithm. 

    Also it contains the <i>RunKeel.jar</i> file which is used in order to run the experiment. 

    <br>

  </li>

  <li><i>datasets</i> directory:</b> it contains the used in the experiment. A directory for each 

    dataset is created. <br>

  </li>

  <li><i>results</i> directory:</b> it contains the output files generated by each algorithm. 

    It has the same structure that the 'scripts' directory. </li>

</ul>

  Note: if the experiment generation is completed successfully, we will see 
  a message similar to the following dialog.</p>
