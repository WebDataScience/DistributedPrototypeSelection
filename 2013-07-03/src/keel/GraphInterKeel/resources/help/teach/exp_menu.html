  <p><b>MENU BAR</b></p>

</div>

<p>Each item of the menu bar contains different submenus. These are the 

  different options available:</p>

<ol>
  <li><i>File Menu </i> 
    <ul>
      <li><b>New Experiment:</b> creates a new experiment. This option is also available
			 from the tool bar via the button <img src="imag/ico_nuevo.jpg">. </li>
      <li><b>Load Experiment:</b> opens an existing experiment. In the open dialog 
        box, select a filename, and click Open. Experiments files usually have 
        the extension <i>.exp</i>. This option is also available
			 from the tool bar via the button <img src="imag/ico_abrir.jpg">. </li>
      <li><b>Save Experiment:</b> saves the current experiment to a file. If it is 
        the first time that the experiment is saved, you will be asked about destination 
        path. This option is also available
			 from the tool bar via the button <img src="imag/ico_guardar.jpg">. </li>
      <li><b>Save Experiment As:</b> saves current experiment in a file. In the 
        save dialog box, introduce the destination path where the file will be 
        saved. </li>
      <li><b>Exit:</b> closes the experiment design software. If the experiment 
        has not been saved yet, you can do it at this moment. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><i>View Menu </i> 
    <ul>
      <li><b>Status Bar:</b> shows/hides the status bar (at the bottom of the windows). 
        It is activated initially. </li>
      <li><b>Grid:</b> shows/hides the alignment grid. In order to make easy the alignment 
        of the elements inserted in the draw area, it is better to activate it since it will help you to create elegant designs. </li>
			 <li><b>Help Panel:</b> shows/hides the help panel. It is activated initially. This option is also available
			 from the tool bar via the button <img src="imag/ico_help.jpg">.</li>
 			 <li><b>DataSets/Algorithm:</b> shows/hides the panel containing the datasets/algorithms. It is activated initially. This option is also available
			 from the tool bar via the button <img src="imag/ico_alg.jpg">.</li>		
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><i>Edit Menu </i> 
    <ul>
      <li><b>Undo:</b> with this option user can undo some executed actions. This 
        option is also available from the tool bar via the button <img src="imag/ico_deshacer.jpg">. </li>
      <li><b>Redo:</b> with this option user can redo some undone actions.This 
        option is also available from the tool bar via the button <img src="imag/ico_rehacer.jpg">.</li>
      <li><b>Select:</b> allows users to select one or more elements in the draw 
        area. This 
        option is also available from the tool bar via the button <img src="imag/ico_select.jpg">.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><i>Tools Menu </i> 
    <ul>
      <li><b>Insert Dataflow:</b> allows to connect algorithm outputs (or dataset) 
        to the inputs of another algorithm, creating a data flow that will be 
        run later. This 
        option is also available from the tool bar via the button <img src="imag/ico_flujo.jpg"></li>
      <li><b>Import algorithm KEEL packet:</b> in order to insert an user's method, select 
        this option and explore the path to choose the method.</li>
      <li><b>Snapshot:</b> it is possible to save the experiment design in an image 
        format file (JPEG). This way allows you to insert it in any document, 
        article, etc... TThis 
        option is also available from the tool bar via the button <img src="imag/ico_snap.jpg"> </li>
      <li><b>Run Experiment:</b> when experiment is finished, use this option 
        to create a ZIP file containing a directory structure with all the 
        files needed to run the designed experiment in the local computer 
        selected by the user. This option is also available from the tool bar via the button <img src="imag/ico_run.jpg">. </li>
      <li><b>Seed:</b> sets up the value of the seed used by the random number generator. If there 
        is any algorithm (inserted in the experiment) that needs to generate random 
        numbers, it will take in a seed created from the initial seed value. This 
        seed can be established automatically or you can insert a 
        value manually. This is shown at the following picture:<br><br>
        <div align="center"><img src="imag/exp_seed.jpg"></div>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><i>Help Menu </i> 
    <ul>
      <li><b>Content:</b> show a help dialog that contains information about how 
        to use this program. </li>
      <li><b>About ... :</b> shows a dialog with basic information about the program 
        as name, authors, version, etc... </li>
    </ul>
