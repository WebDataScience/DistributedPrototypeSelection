<p>There are two tool bars in this program. One of them appears under the menu bar. Pressing on its buttons it is possible 

  to access to the most frequently used options that appear in the menus. It looks like this:</p>
	<p align="center"><img src="imag/exp_toolTop.jpg"></p>
	 
<p>	The other one is located on the left of the main window, and it contains buttons to perform 

  specific options of design. It look like this:</p> 
	
	<p align="center"><img src="imag/exp_toolLeft.jpg"></p>
	

	
<p>	If you put the mouse over a button, it will appear a 

  short description about it.<br>
