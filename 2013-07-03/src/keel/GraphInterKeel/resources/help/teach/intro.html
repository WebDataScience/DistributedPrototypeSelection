  <p><b>INTRODUCTION</b></p>

  </div>

  <p>KEEL is a software tool developed to build and use different 

    Data Mining models. We would like to remark that this is the first software 

    tool of this type containing a free code Java library of Evolutionary Learning Algorithms. The main features of KEEL are:</p>

<ul>

  <li> It contains pre-processing algorithms: transformation, discretization, 

    instance selections and feature selections. </li>

  <li> It also contains a Knowledge Extraction Algorithms Library, supervised 

    and unsupervised, remarking the incorporation of multiple evolutionary learning 

    algorithms. </li>

  <li> It has a statistical analysis library to analyze algorithms. </li>

  <li> It includes a Java Class Library for Evolutionary Computation (JCLEC). 

  </li>

  <li> It contains an user-friendly interface, oriented to the analysis of algorithms. 

  </li>

  <li> KEEL's environment can connect to Internet to download new data files for 

    using them in future analysis. </li>

</ul>

<p>We can distinguish three parts in the graphic environment:</p>

<ul>

  <li>The Preparation of the Data Bases part allow users to create different partitions 

    of his own data bases or the data bases available in the KEEL web. Also, it is 

    possible to edit, apply transformations, generate DataSets in the correct 

    format from UCI files or view datailed plots about a concrete DataSet.</li>

  <li>The Design of Experiments part has the objective of designing the desired experiments 

    using a graphical interface. After the experiment is designed, the interface 

    generates a .ZIP file containing a directory structure with all the necessary 

    files needed to run those experiments in the local computer.<br>

    The interface also allows the user to add his own algorithms to the experimentation 

    being designed. The only requirement is to accept the input file format of 

    KEEL. Even, it is not needed to use the Java language for the own algorithms 

    of the user. This provides a very flexible way for the user to compare his 

    own methods with the ones in KEEL.</li>

  <li>The Generation of Evolutionary Algorithms with the JCLEC library allows 

    the user to create his own evolutionary algorithms using a graphical interface. 

    In this version of KEEL, this part is NOT implemented.</li>

</ul>
